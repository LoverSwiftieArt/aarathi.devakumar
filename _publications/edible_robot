excerpt: 'Robots are becoming more technologically advanced every day in their reliability, efficiency, and accuracy in completing tasks. However, the materials used to make robots can not only cause excessive waste but also may contain toxic components that may pollute the environment. Demands of using less environmentally harmful materials are drastically increasing particularly for applications that are interacting with living organisms and nature. We aim to explore vegan food-derived materials for robot parts that have less impact on the environment in terms of manufacturing processes and after-uses.'
