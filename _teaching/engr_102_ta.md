ENGR 102 teaches first-year engineering students how to solve problems using the Python programming language. This is a course that not only helps these students learn the basic concepts of software design through implementing and debugging programs, but helps them learn about various engineering majors and explore careers. As a teaching assistant for this course, I assisted over 100+ engineering students with their labs and assignments, collaborated with instructors to create an engaging and supportive environment for students to learn, and provided constructive feedback to students' assigments and exams.
