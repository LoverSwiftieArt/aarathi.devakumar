CLEN 181 is a course that serves to help first-year engineering students transition easily from high school to Texas A&M Engineering through provided resources and mentorship. As a peer mentor, I collaborated with an instructor to create engaging activities for a 30 student class and also provided personal stories and advice for engineering students on how to be successful and well-rounded. I also met with students individually to check in on their progress and well-being during their first semester at Texas A&M and communicated with them on ways to help them.
